# TASK

This is a simple task from my tutor, which is divided into two task files i.e Task 1 and Task 2.

## Task 1

This is a simple Algorithm that loops through 1 - 15 and appends it to the browser (HTML file), and tells if the number is an Odd or an Even Number.

## Task 2

This is a simple algorithm that loops through an array and alerts the highest number on the browser. It also prints the output on the page.
